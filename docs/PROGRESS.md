# Project progress & slice lifecycle

**Read this file at the start of every new task** before writing specs, plans, or code.
It is the canonical snapshot of what exists, what each slice proved, and what is still open.

## Current status

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Latest completed slice** | v4 — `take-a-hit` (bidirectional combat + player hit/death reactions) |
| **Active branch** | `feature/animate-and-react` (v2–v4 work; **not yet merged to `main`**) |
| **CI gate** | `make ci` — expected green on the feature branch |
| **Next slice** | **Not chosen.** See [Open gaps & deferred work](#open-gaps--deferred-work) for candidates. |

### Slice numbering note

ADR-0001 sometimes calls the first slice **v1**; repo docs call it **v0**
(`first-playable-vertical-slice`). This file uses **v0–v4** to match spec/plan filenames.

## Slice lifecycle

Slices are small, end-to-end proofs. Each ships: shared contracts → Go sim → Godot client →
Python bot/smoke → golden fixtures → `make ci` green.

There is **no v5 spec or plan yet**.

## What each slice proved

### v0 — First playable vertical slice

**Proves:** ADR-0001 architecture end-to-end.

- Go authoritative server + Godot thin client over JSON WebSocket
- Dev auth, solo session create/resume, Postgres persistence
- Deterministic 20 Hz sim (move, attack, loot drop, pickup, equip)
- Seeded replay + Python protocol bot + headless Godot smoke
- `GET /v0/sessions/{id}/state` inspection for agents

**Key as-built decisions:** session-scoped inventory (not character-scoped); WebSocket
`?access_token=` fallback; monster corpse at `hp == 0`; combat always hits in v0 (no range gate).

### v2 — Equip and see it

**Proves:** ADR-0001 D7 Tier A + ADR-0006 asset pipeline contract.

- Shared `item_visuals.v0.json` + `assets.v0.json` → Godot mount on `right_hand_socket`
- Deterministic `gen_glb.py` runtime assets; `make validate-assets`
- Equipped `rusty_sword` visible on character; server authority unchanged
- Resume restores equipped weapon from persisted inventory

**Scope limit:** only `rusty_sword` has a visual mapping; other items deferred.

### v3 — Animate and react

**Proves:** ADR-0007 animation state model; rigged GLB → skeletal clips pipeline.

- Player: `idle` / `walk` / `attack` from client input/prediction; weapon on `hand_r` bone
- Monster: `hit` / `death` from authoritative `monster_damaged` / `monster_killed` events
- `AnimationController` priority machine: terminal > one-shot > locomotion
- Clips built by `client/tools/build_animations.gd` → committed `.tres` libraries
- **No server/protocol change** — client starts reading existing `state_delta.events`

### v4 — Take a hit

**Proves:** Bidirectional combat + player reactions on the same event-driven path as monsters.

- Per-monster optional `retaliation_damage` in `shared/rules/monsters.v0.json`
- Server emits `player_damaged` / `player_killed`; dead player intents rejected
- Client: player `hit` / `death` clips; input gated when `hp <= 0`
- Golden: `pinned_seed` `deadbeefdeadbeef` → `final_player_hp: 9` (one hit, one retaliation)
- Bot/smoke assert `hp < 10` on random seeds (not exact golden HP)
- Extras: `test_golden.gd` retaliation gate; `make bot-visual` for interactive inspection

**Explicit non-goals (still true):** no respawn, no healing, no monster attack anim on retaliate.

## Architecture decisions (ADRs)

| ADR | Topic | Status |
|-----|-------|--------|
| [0001](adr/0001-technology-stack.md) | Foundational stack (Go server, Godot client, shared rules, replay, bot) | Accepted |
| [0006](adr/0006-asset-pipeline.md) | glTF-first assets, manifests, sockets, validation | Accepted; v3 as-built for rigged GLBs |
| [0007](adr/0007-animation-state-model.md) | Client-only animation; event-driven reactions | Accepted; v4 as-built for player reactions |

Anticipated but **not written:** netcode timing, Protobuf migration, production auth, multiplayer split
(see ADR-0001 follow-up list).

---

## Scripted vertical slice flow (bot + smoke)

Every slice keeps this loop working unless the spec explicitly changes it:

```text
dev-login → create session → move → attack training dummy → pick up loot → equip rusty_sword
```

After v4 the player **survives with reduced HP** (`hp < 10`). Monster dies; player may take retaliation
each successful hit.

**Verify:**

```bash
make db-up && make server    # terminal 1
make bot                     # terminal 2 — protocol bot
make client-smoke            # headless Godot gates + slice smoke
make ci                      # full suite
make bot-visual              # optional — watch autoplay in Godot window
```

---

## Open gaps & deferred work

Do **not** assume these are the next slice — they are documented backlog items agents should know about.

### Known unsatisfiable / partial behavior (highest-signal follow-up)

**Combat/world state does not persist on session resume.** Resume rebuilds the sim from
`seed + inventory` only (`server/internal/realtime/hub.go`). Monster death and player HP are
**not** restored authoritatively — the dummy respawns at full HP on reconnect. Client harnesses
(`test_animation.gd`, smoke snapshot branches) verify **client wiring** for death poses; default
smoke does not assert server-persisted player death on resume. Documented in
`spec-animate-and-react.md` §11 and `spec-take-a-hit.md` §11.

### Other deferred items (from specs / ADRs)

| Area | Deferred item | Source |
|------|---------------|--------|
| Persistence | Cross-session **character-scoped** inventory | v0 as-built §10 |
| Combat | Attack range, miss chance, healing, armor, respawn | v0/v4 non-goals |
| Content | Visual mappings for items beyond `rusty_sword` | equip spec §4.9 |
| Assets | Blender export pipeline, texture budget, remote patcher | ADR-0006 |
| Platform | Production auth provider, dashboards, historical inspect API | v0 §8, ADR-0001 |
| Protocol | Protobuf / `godobuf` migration | ADR-0001 |
| Multiplayer | Matchmaking, multi-player sessions, split deployables | v0 non-goals, ADR-0001 |

## Starting a new task (agent checklist)

1. **Read this file** (`docs/PROGRESS.md`) — confirm baseline slice and open gaps.
2. **Read ADR-0001** and any feature-specific ADRs listed above.
3. **Spec first** — create or read `docs/specs/spec-<feature>.md` (SDD).
4. **Plan second** — create `docs/plans/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<feature>.md` with file map + verification commands.
5. **Branch** — `feature/<codename>` off latest integration branch (today: merge target TBD).
6. **Implement** shared → server → client → bot/smoke → docs; keep `make ci` green.
7. **Update this file** when the slice completes: new row in lifecycle table, summary, and any new gaps.

### Invariants (do not break)

- Go sim determinism: seeded RNG only, no wall-clock in `game/`, stable ordering.
- Shared rules are **data**; formulas evaluated in Go + GDScript from the same golden fixtures.
- Animation is client-only; new reactions need a **server event** first, then client mapping.
- Golden changes require Go tests **and** GDScript `test_golden.gd` / `validate_shared.py` updates.
